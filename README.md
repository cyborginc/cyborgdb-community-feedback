# CyborgDB Community Feedback

Public repository for tracking technical feedback, bugs, and feature requests for CyborgDB.

> **🚀 Hackathon Participants (Nov 27 - Dec 20, 2025):** See [HACKATHON.md](HACKATHON.md) for award eligibility and submission requirements.

## About This Repo

This is where we track real-world feedback from teams building with CyborgDB's encrypted vector search. Whether you hit a performance bottleneck, found an integration gap, or discovered an edge case we missed—this is where to document it.

## How to Submit Feedback

1. **Search existing issues first** - Someone may have already reported it
2. **Use the issue template** - Click "New Issue" and fill out all fields
3. **Be specific** - Reproduction steps, environment details, and actual numbers matter
4. **File as you go** - Don't wait to batch issues at the end

## What We Want to Hear About

- **Performance bottlenecks** - Actual latency numbers 
- **Integration pain points** - LangChain rough edges, LlamaIndex gaps, framework incompatibilities
- **Deployment issues** - Docker quirks, serverless limitations, configuration problems
- **Industry-specific issues** - Healthcare, fintech, or enterprise requirements we didn't account for
- **Documentation gaps** - Confusing error messages, missing examples, unclear instructions
- **Bugs and crashes** - Anything that breaks unexpectedly

## What Makes Good Feedback

✅ **Detailed reproduction steps** - "Here's exactly how to trigger this issue"  
✅ **Environment specifics** - Version, deployment type, backing store, OS  
✅ **Actual measurements** - "Query took 47ms"  
✅ **Impact assessment** - "This blocks production deployment because..."

❌ "It doesn't work" with no context  
❌ Questions about setup (use support channels for those)  
❌ Feature requests without explaining the use case

## Getting Help

## For Hackathon Participants

Filing issues here is **required** for the Most Valuable Technical Feedback award. Quality matters more than quantity—one excellent reproduction case beats ten vague complaints.
